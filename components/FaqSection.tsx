      question: "How is GovBiz Agent different from other contract notification services?",
      answer: "Unlike traditional services that simply alert you to solicitations, GovBiz Agent focuses on the earlier, more strategic Sources Sought notices where you can influence requirements. Our system doesn't just notifyâ€”it analyzes fit, generates responses, and manages your entire pipeline."
    },
    {
      question: "What sources does GovBiz Agent monitor?",
      answer: "Our primary focus is SAM.gov for Sources Sought notices. We plan to expand to other relevant federal procurement portals and potentially state/local opportunities based on user feedback."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does GovBiz Agent cost?",
      answer: "We offer several pricing tiers to fit different needs, starting at $19/month for our Scout plan, $99/month for our popular Agent Pro plan, and $299/month for our Strategist Suite. You can view detailed pricing and features on our pricing page."
    },
    {
      question: "How much time can GovBiz Agent save my team?",
      answer: "Most customers report saving 70-80% of the time previously spent on manual opportunity identification and initial response drafting. Our ROI calculator can help you estimate your specific time and cost savings based on your team's current processes."
    },
    {
      question: "When will GovBiz Agent be available?",
      answer: "GovBiz Agent is currently in the validation and early development phase. We're actively building our core AI models and user interface based on feedback from our waitlist and early access partners. We expect to launch a beta version in Q1 2024."
    },
    {
      question: "How is the AI trained?",
      answer: "We're building GovBiz Agent using state-of-the-art large language models, fine-tuned on a vast dataset of federal contracting documents (Sources Sought, RFPs, capability statements), combined with secure cloud infrastructure and a user-friendly web interface."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a free trial available?",
      answer: "Yes, we'll offer a 14-day free trial for all paid plans when we launch. You can join our waitlist now to be notified when we launch and receive early access."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get started with GovBiz Agent?",
      answer: "Currently, you can join our waitlist to be among the first to access GovBiz Agent when we launch. You can also explore our demo to get a feel for how the system will work."
