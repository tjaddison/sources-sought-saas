    answer: "Unlike traditional services that simply alert you to solicitations, GovWin AI focuses on the earlier, more strategic Sources Sought notices where you can influence requirements. Our system doesn't just notifyâ€”it analyzes fit, generates responses, and manages your entire pipeline."

              <p className="text-gray-600">
                We&apos;re currently in the research and development phase. Our plan is to launch a beta version to early access partners in Q1 2024, with a public launch targeted for Q2 2024, depending on feedback and testing results.

              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Early access participants get preview access to our prototype as it&apos;s being developed. You&apos;ll provide feedback that directly shapes the product, while securing benefits like discounted pricing when we launch.

              <p className="text-gray-600">
                The beta will focus on our core functionality: opportunity matching and requirements analysis for Sources Sought notices. Additional features like response generation will be added as development progresses.

              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Yes, if we don&apos;t launch the product or if you&apos;re unsatisfied with the beta, we&apos;ll refund your founding member fee. Our goal is to build something truly valuable for federal contractors.

              <p className="text-gray-600">
                We value your time. We&apos;ll ask for occasional feedback (15-30 minutes per month) through surveys and optional group feedback sessions. You can choose your level of involvement.

                Security is a priority even in beta. Your data will be encrypted, stored securely, and never shared with third parties. We&apos;ll provide a data processing agreement for early users with specific privacy requirements.
